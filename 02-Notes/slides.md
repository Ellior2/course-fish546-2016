>I tried to make a file with Sublime 2 from the terminal using the CLI (command line interface) subl I was unsuccessful. I tried to make a symlink to subl using the instructions here but when I ran

`ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" ~/bin/subl`

>I just got a 'no such file or dir exists error'. I didn't try too hard though, so will make another attempt
